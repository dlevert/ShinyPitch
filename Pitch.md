Introduction
========================================================

<font size="6">
* The app was built as a project for course project.)<br/>

* I decided to build an app to predict probabilities.<br/>

* I also decided to build the app to produce a normal
distribution graph based on just a mean and standard deviation.<br/>

* I struggled with this in the past and decided it would be a good refresher 
and provide a tool to use again in the future.<br/>

* The link to the app is <http://dlevert.shinyapps.io/myapp><br/>

* The link to the repo is <https://github.com/dlevert/ShinyPitch.git>

Why Reproducible is better
========================================================

<font size="6">
<br/>
Using tools to share code and results:<br/>

* Ensures others can reproduce the results you produced.<br/>
* Demonstrates the methods on how the research was performed.<br/>
* Builds confidence in your results.<br/>
* Builds confidence in your methods.<br/>
* Builds trust with other.<br/>

Example
========================================================

For this example, the mean is 10, the standard deviation is 5, the value to be evaluated is 7

The chances of getting a  7  is  72.57 %.
